1️⃣ What is ASP.NET Core?
ASP.NET Core is a modern, cross-platform, open-source framework for building web applications, APIs, and services. It is the evolution of ASP.NET, redesigned to be faster, more lightweight, and modular.

2️⃣ Key Features of ASP.NET Core
✅ Cross-Platform – Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux
✅ High Performance – Faster than ASP.NET Framework
✅ Open-Source – Developed and maintained by Microsoft & the community
✅ Modular & Lightweight – Uses NuGet packages instead of a bulky framework
✅ Built-in Dependency Injection – Helps manage dependencies efficiently
✅ Supports Multiple Hosting Models – Self-hosted (Kestrel) or IIS

3️⃣ ASP.NET Core vs ASP.NET Framework
Feature	ASP.NET Core	ASP.NET Framework
Platform	Cross-Platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)	Windows Only
Performance	Faster & More Optimized	Slower due to older architecture
Hosting	Kestrel, IIS, Docker, Cloud	IIS Only
Modularity	Uses small NuGet packages	Monolithic
Open Source	Yes ✅	No ❌
4️⃣ What Can You Build with ASP.NET Core?
💡 Web APIs – For mobile apps, frontend apps, and microservices
💡 Web Applications – MVC-based or Razor Pages apps
💡 Real-Time Apps – Using SignalR (e.g., chat apps)
💡 Microservices – Small, independent services
💡 Serverless Functions – Deployed on Azure Functions

5️⃣ How ASP.NET Core Web API Works (Simple Overview)
When a client (e.g., a web browser or mobile app) sends a request to an ASP.NET Core Web API, it follows this process:

1️⃣ Request Received → Sent to the API Endpoint (Controller)
2️⃣ Processing → Executes business logic (e.g., fetching data from a database)
3️⃣ Response Sent → Returns data as JSON (default format)

📝 Example: Simple API Response When you visit https://yourapi.com/products, the API returns:
